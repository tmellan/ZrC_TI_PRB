We analyze the relations between the two main approaches, based on calculation of the free energies of solid and liquid and on direct simulation of the two coexisting phases. Although both approaches rely on the use of classical reference systems consisting of parameterized empirical interaction models, we point out that in the free energy approach the final results are independent of the reference system, whereas in the current form of the coexistence approach they depend on it. We present a scheme for correcting the predictions of the coexistence approach for differences between the reference and {\{}$\backslash$em ab initio{\}} systems. To illustrate the practical operation of the scheme, we present calculations of the high-pressure melting properties of iron using the corrected coexistence approach, which agree closely with earlier results from the free energy approach. A quantitative assessment is also given of finite-size errors, which we show can be reduced to a negligible size.},

To understand this behaviour, rarely seen in equilibrium simulations, we quenched and examined a set of lattices containing a Frenkel pair. Five metastable structures were found, and their formation energies and electronic properties were studied. Their thermal generation was found to be facilitated by a reduction of between 0.7 and 1.5 eV in formation energy due to thermal expansion of the lattice. With input from a quasi-harmonic description of the defect free energy of formation, an ideal solution model was used to estimate lower bounds on their concentration as a function of temperature and stoichiometry. At 3000 K (0.81 of the melting temperature) their concentration was estimated to be 1.2{\%} per mole in a stoichiometric crystal, and 0.3{\%} per mole in a crystal with 10{\%} per mole of constitutional vacancies. Their contribution to heat capacity, thermal expansion and bulk modulus was estimated.},

The ab initio calculations are based on density-functional theory in the generalized-gradient approximation, and are performed using the projector augmented wave approach. Thermal excitation of electrons is fully included. The Helmholtz free energy consists of three parts, associated with the rigid perfect lattice, harmonic lattice vibrations, and anharmonic contributions, and the technical problems of calculating these parts to high precision are investigated. The harmonic part is obtained by computing the phonon frequencies over the entire Brillouin zone, and by summation of the free-energy contributions associated with the phonon modes. The anharmonic part is computed by the technique of thermodynamic integration using carefully designed reference systems. Detailed results are presented for the pressure, specific heat, bulk modulus, expansion coefficient and Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter, and comparisons are made with values obtained from diamond-anvil-cell and shock experiments.},

abstract = {Multicomponent alloys with multiple principal elements including high entropy alloys (HEAs) and compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) are attracting rapidly growing attention. The endless possibilities to explore new alloys and the hope for better combinations of materials properties have stimulated a remarkable number of research works in the last years. Most of these works have been based on experimental approaches, but ab initio calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiment and serves as a predictive tool for the identification and characterization of promising alloys. The theoretical ab initio modeling of phase stabilities and mechanical properties of multi-principal element alloys by means of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed. A general thermodynamic framework is laid down that provides a bridge between the quantities accessible with DFT and the targeted thermodynamic and mechanical properties. It is shown how chemical disorder and various finite-temperature excitations can be modeled with DFT. Different concepts to study crystal and alloy phase stabilities, the impact of lattice distortions (a core effect of HEAs), magnetic transitions, and chemical short-range order are discussed along with specific examples. Strategies to study elastic properties, stacking fault energies, and their dependence on, e.g., temperature or alloy composition are illustrated. Finally, we provide an extensive compilation of multi-principal element alloys and various material properties studied with DFT so far (a set of over 500 alloy-property combinations).},

In this Letter, the phonon spectrum is recalculated by using density-functional theory ab initio methods fully including anharmonic effects up to fourth order at 50 GPa. Considering that the perturbation theory cannot be employed with imaginary harmonic frequencies, a variational procedure based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality is used to estimate the renormalized phonon frequencies. The results show that strong quantum anharmonic effects make the imaginary phonons become positive even at zero temperature so that the simple cubic phase becomes mechanically stable, as experiments suggest. Moreover, our calculations find a superconducting T(c) in agreement with experiments and predict an anomalous behavior of the specific heat.},

Phys. Comm. 196 (2015) 439 External routines: TOMS611 Unconstrained Minimization [1] included in the MEAMfit code. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Fitting embedded atom method (EAM) and reference-free modified embedded atom method (RF-MEAM) potentials [2–3] to energies and forces produced by VASP [4–7]. Solution method: A computer program is presented which uses a conjugate-gradient minimizer paired with a genetic algorithm to fit EAM and RF-MEAM potentials to energies and/or atomic forces read directly from VASP output files. Potentials produced by the code are directly usable with the LAMMPS [8] or Camelion [9] molecular-dynamics packages. Reasons for new version: Bugs fixed; improvements made. Summary of revisions: Various bug fixes; speed of single-shot energy and force calculations (not optimization) increased by ×10; elements up to Cn (Z=112) now correctly read from vasprun.xml files; EAM fits now produce Camelion output files; changed max number of vasprun.xml files to 10,000 (an unnecessary lower limit of 10 was allowed in the previous version). Additional comments: User manual provided. !!!!! The distribution file for this program is over 65 MB and therefore is not delivered directly when download or Email is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. !!!!! Running time: The run-time depends on the required level of accuracy of the final potential. For an EAM potential fit to 670 energies, a few hours on a single core is usually sufficient to produce a potential with R=12{\%}–13{\%} (see Equation. 9 in main-text for definition). To ensure a maximally optimized potential however (R=12{\%}), a run-time of 24 h is recommended. To optimize a RF-MEAM potential, a further 24 h should be allowed. One will already find an improvement over the EAM using just a single core, however to ensure a maximally optimized potential, one should run several instances of MEAMfit in parallel.

abstract = {The energy bands of the 4d transition metal series are computed self-consistently within the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) over a range where the volume changes by nearly an order of magnitude about the equilibrium atomic volume. The parameters defining the position and width of the s and d bands are tabulated across the series and as a function of volume. A theoretical interpretation of the trends gives a more detailed understanding of the electronic structure of transition metals. The bottom of the conduction band is accurately described by an Ashcroft empty core pseudopotential. The centre of the d band is fitted very well by an exponential, and the width approximately satisfies Heine's inverse five-thirds volume dependence. The d band occupancy to the left of the series is very sensitive to the relative ion core volume which Duthie and Pettifor show as explaining the rare earth crystal structure trend. The ASA includes explicitly the very important bonding d charge in addition to the usual renormalized atom contribution.},

@article{Glensk2014,
abstract = {We study the temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy of vacancy formation in Al and Cu from T ¼ 0 K up to the melting temperature, fully taking into account anharmonic contributions. Our results show that the formation entropy of vacancies is not constant as often assumed but increases almost linearly with temperature. The resulting highly nonlinear temperature dependence in the Gibbs formation energy naturally explains the differences between positron annihilation spectroscopy and differential dilatometry data and shows that nonlinear thermal corrections are crucial to extrapolate high-temperature experimental data to T ¼ 0 K. Employing these corrections—rather than the linear Arrhenius extrapolation that is commonly assumed in analyzing experimental data—revised formation enthalpies are obtained that differ up to 20{\%} from the previously accepted ones. Using the revised experimental formation enthalpies, we show that a large part of the discrepancies between DFT-GGA and unrevised experimental vacancy formation energies disappears. The substantial shift between previously accepted and the newly revised T ¼ 0 K formation enthalpies also has severe consequences in benchmarking ab initio methods against experiments, e.g., in deriving corrections that go beyond commonly used LDA and GGA exchange- correlation functionals such as the AM05 functional.},

abstract = {Phase stability and macroscopic performances of ZrC are closely related to the behavior of native point defects. In this study, structures and stabilities of native point defects in ZrC as well as diffusion of C-related defects are investigated by first-principles calculations. It is shown that the carbon vacancy (V-C) and interstitials (C(i)s) are the dominant native point defects in ZrC. Six types of C-i configurations: two C-trimers, one C-tetrahedron, and three C-dimers are identified with low defect formation energies. The V-C has a high migration energy (4.39eV) which suggests its low mobility in ZrC. The C(i)s have low diffusion energy barriers (from 0.26 to 1.29eV) which lead to their high mobility. In addition, the impact of defects (V-C, V-Zr, Zr-C, and C-Zr) on bonding strengths of neighboring Zr-C bonds is discussed. Especially near V-C, the 1NN (nearest neighboring) and 2NN Zr-C bonds are strengthened but 4NN Zr-C bonds are weakened. Interestingly, the 3NN Zr-C bonds are almost not affected by the presence of V-C. These results may be closely related to the short-range interactions and ordering of V-C in nonstoichiometric ZrC.},

abstract = {Materials science is a highly interdisciplinary field. It is devoted to the understanding of the relationship between (a) fundamental physical and chemical properties governing processes at the atomistic scale with (b) typically macroscopic properties required of materials in engineering applications. For many materials, this relationship is not only determined by chemical composition, but strongly governed by microstructure. The latter is a consequence of carefully selected process conditions (e.g., mechanical forming and annealing in metallurgy or epitaxial growth in semiconductor technology). A key task of computational materials science is to unravel the often hidden composition-structure-property relationships using computational techniques. The present paper does not aim to give a complete review of all aspects of materials science. Rather, we will present the key concepts underlying the computation of selected material properties and discuss the major classes of materials to which they are applied. Specifically, our focus will be on methods used to describe single or polycrystalline bulk materials of semiconductor, metal or ceramic form.},

A crucial aspect when applying these strategies is to carefully check, and if possible to control, a variety of intrinsic errors and their propagation through a particular multi- methodological scheme. The first part of our paper critically reviews a few selected sources of errors frequently occurring in quantum-mechanical approaches to materials science and their multi-scale prop- agation when describing properties of multi-component and multi-phase polycrystalline metallic alloys. Our analysis is illustrated in particular on the determination of i) thermodynamic materials properties at finite temperatures and ii) integral elastic responses. The second part addresses methodological challenges emerging at interfaces between electronic structure and/or atomistic modeling on the one side and selected continuum methods, such as crystal elasticity and crystal plasticity finite element method (CEFEM and CPFEM), new fast Fourier transforms (FFT) approach, and phase-field modeling, on the other side. 1},

Although several theoretical studies have suggested an electronic phase transition in molybdenum disulphide, there has been a lack of experimental evidence. Here we report comprehensive studies on the pressure-dependent electronic, vibrational, optical and structural properties of multilayered molybdenum disulphide up to 35 GPa. Our experimental results reveal a structural lattice distortion followed by an electronic transition from a semiconducting to metallic state atB19 GPa, which is confirmed byab initio calculations. The metallization arises from the overlap of the valance and conduction bands owing to sulphur–sulphur interactions as the interlayer spacing reduces. The electronic transition affords modulation of the opto-electronic gain in molybdenum disulphide. This pressure-tuned behaviour can enable the development of novel devices with multiple phenomena involving the strong coupling of the mechanical, electrical and optical properties of layered nanomaterials.},

We then consider the effects of doping on the Raman spectra of graphene. The Fermi energy is tuned by applying a gate-voltage. We show that this induces a stiffening of the Raman G peak for both holes and electrons doping.

abstract = {TaC, HfC and their solid solutions are promising candidate materials for thermal protection structures in hypersonic vehicles because of their very high melting temperatures ({\textgreater}4000 K) among other properties. The melting temperatures of slightly hypostoichiometric TaC, HfC and three solid solution compositions (Ta1−xHfxC, with x = 0.8, 0.5 and 0.2) have long been identified as the highest known. In the current research, they were reassessed, for the first time in the last fifty years, using a laser heating technique. They were found to melt in the range of 4041–4232 K, with HfC having the highest and TaC the lowest. Spectral radiance of the hot samples was measured in situ, showing that the optical emissivity of these compounds plays a fundamental role in their heat balance. Independently, the results show that the melting point for HfC0.98, (4232 ± 84) K, is the highest recorded for any compound studied until now.},

abstract = {ZrC is a nonoxide high-temperature ceramic used for applications in harsh environments with corrosive and oxidizing conditions like nuclear reactor and nozzle flaps of jet propulsion engines. Moreover, easy oxidation of the crystal surfaces affects the excellent mechanical and physical proper- ties. It is however imperative to study the oxidation processes on the different low index surfaces. DFT studies in conjunction with atomistic thermodynamic modeling have been used for this purpose. The (100) surface completely dissociates molecular oxygen into atomic species, and the surface is fully covered with oxygen atoms at a wide range of temperatures and pressures, recovering the bare surface at temperatures in excess of 1500 K. The (111) surface interacts strongly with O2 by completely dissociating it into atomic species which adsorb at 3-fold fcc hollow sites. This surface is extremely difficult to clean of oxygen by manipulation of temperature and pressure alone. The bare surface cannot be recovered even at temperatures above 1800 K. The (110) surface on the other hand has a complex oxidation process, accumulating eight O atoms leading to the formation of surface ZrO2 units with the release of CO2. This ZrO2-covered surface is highly stable and cannot be removed at temperatures below 2000 K by manipulating temperature and pressure alone. Wulff construction of the equilibrium morphology of the nanocrystallites upon oxidation reveals only the ZrO2-covered (110) surface. I.},

Current methodologies described here include the compound energy formalism of CALPHAD, besides the rather different but related canonical and grand-canonical formalisms. We show how the calculation of appropriate defect formation energies should be formulated, how they are included in the different formalisms and in turn how these yield equilibrium defect concentrations and their contribution to free energies and chemical potentials.

abstract = {Ab initio calculations of the elastic constants for several cubic ordered structures of zirconium carbonitride (ZrC(x)N(1-x)) and zirconium-titanium carbide (Zr(x)Ti(1-x)C) alloys were carried out. The calculations of total and formation energies, bulk modulus and elastic constants as functions of composition were performed with an ab initio pseudo-potential method. The predicted equilibrium lattice parameters are slightly higher than those found experimentally (on average by 0.2-0.4{\%}). The predicted formation energies indicate that the ZrC(x)N(1-x) alloys are stable even at 0 K in the whole concentration range, while the homogeneous Zr(x)Ti(1-x)C alloys can be stabilized only at high temperatures. Spinodal decomposition of the latter alloys into cubic domains takes place over a wide range of compositions and temperatures. For the carbonitrides, the shear modulus G, the Young's modulus E and the Poisson ratio $\sigma$ reach an extremum for carbon-rich alloys, and this is attributed to a maximum value of the shear modulus C(44) that corresponds to a valence-electron concentration in the range of 8.2-8.3. This extremal behavior finds its origin in the response of the band structure of ZrC(x)N(1-x) alloys for 0≤x≤1, caused by the monoclinic strain that determines this shear modulus. In contrast, the other shear modulus [Formula: see text] does not exhibit any extremum over the whole composition range. These results are in contrast with those for Zr-Ti carbides for which the elastic properties gradually increase from ZrC to TiC.},

abstract = {H ypersonic flights, re-entry vehicles, and propulsion applications all require new materials that can perform in oxidizing or corrosive atmospheres at temperatures in excess of 2000°C and sometimes over the course of a long working life. Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs) are good candidates to fulfill these requirements. Within this family, the ZrB2 and HfB2 based composites are the most attractive. The oxidation resistance of diboride-based compounds is better than that of SiC-based ceramics thanks to the formation of multi-oxide scales composed of a refractory oxide (skeleton) and a glass component. Onera is actively involved in several programs to develop such materials for both hypersonic civilian flights and for propulsion systems. In this paper, we present the ZrB2-SiC, ZrB2-SiC-TaSi2 and HfB2-SiC-TaSi2 composites developed in the Onera laboratories for leading edges or air intakes of future hypersonic civilian aircrafts flying up to Mach 6 (T{\~{}}1100°C-1500°C) with comparisons with the state of the art.

This is achieved by mixing the orbitals of different symmetry on a site with coupling coefficients driven by the Coulomb potentials up to octapole level. The additional forces on atoms due to the self-consistency and polarizabilities are exactly obtained by straightforward electrostatics, by analogy with the Hellmann-Feynman theorem as applied in first-principles calculations. The model correctly orders the zero temperature energies of all zirconia polymorphs. The Zr-O matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, which measure covalency, make a greater contribution than the polarizability to the energy differences between phases. Results for elastic constants of the cubic and tetragonal phases and phonon frequencies of the cubic phase are also presented and compared with some experimental data and first-principles calculations.

abstract = {We review here the theory of the early stages of oxidation of the (110) surface of Ni1-xAlx, based on ab initio calculations using a plane-wave pseudopotential method. The clean surface and several oxidized surfaces have been investigated, with oxygen coverages up to 2 ML of oxygen (I ML = 3 0 atoms per 2 surface Al atoms). The theory to date is a description in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics, with a comparison of the free energies of several surfaces of different composition, implemented at the atomic scale. Three environmental parameters are singled out as control variables in this treatment, namely the alloy composition x (assumed to be near 0.5), the temperature T and the partial pressure of oxygen p(O2), With certain reasonable approximations an analytic formula for the surface energy sigma is derived in terms of these variables and some constants that are calculated ab initio together with others that are derived from experimental thermodynamic tables. At oxygen pressures just above the threshold for bulk oxidation of NiAl, the calculations explain the observed formation of a thin film of alumina in place of NiAl surface layers, with the consequent dissolution of Ni into the bulk. Ab initio calculations illustrate how the energetics of supplying Al to the surface depends on bulk stoichiometry, which alters the relative stability of different surface oxidation states so as to favour oxidation more if the alloy is Al-rich than if it is Ni-rich.},

We derive general formulae for them which can be solved numerically. Analytic formulae for the chemical potentials are derived in terms of the point-defect concentrations. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the concentrations which are valid when the constitutional defects (which dominate at low temperatures) continue to dominate the thermally excited defects of the same type at higher temperatures. The energies entering these formulae are defined in a general way, suitable for ab initio or semiempirical methods of calculation. We illustrate the results with calculations for NiAl using three different central N-body potentials. A significant effect is due to the temperature dependence of the formation energies.},

abstract = {A classical potential for ZrC is developed in the form of a modified second-moment approximation with emphasis on the strong directional dependence of the C–Zr interactions. The model has a minimal set of parameters, 4 for the pure metal and 6 for the cross interactions, which are fitted to the database of cohesive energies of B1–, B2–, and B3–ZrC, the heat of formation, and most importantly, the atomic force constants of B1–ZrC from first-principles calculations. The potential is then extensively tested against various physical properties, none of which were considered in the fitting. Finite temperature properties such as thermal expansion and melting point are in excellent agreement with experiments.We believe our model should be a good template for metallic ceramics.},

abstract = {The stability of interstitial defect and dislocation structures in bcc Fe as a function of temperature is believed to play a crucial role in determining defect evolution under irradiation conditions. The vibrational properties of defects constitute one contribution to the corresponding energetics and much work has been done within the harmonic approximation to determine the vibrational formation free energy and formation entropy of such defects. Defects can however exhibit strong local strain fields that break the cubic symmetry of the bcc lattice leading to large anharmonicities and a breakdown of the harmonic approximation as an accurate means to calculate vibrational thermodynamic quantities. Moreover, if defect diffusion is active at a time scale comparable to an atomic vibration, strong anharmonicities will always be present at any finite temperature. The current work investigates the vibrational free energy and entropy of the ⟨110⟩ self-interstitial dumbbell defect in bcc Fe using both harmonic and anharmonic free-energy calculation methods for a range of modern empirical potentials. It is found that depending on the empirical potential and for temperatures where diffusion is limited, the harmonic approximation is justified especially for empirical potentials that have been fitted to third-order elastic constants. The unique applicability range of such calculations for bcc Fe is also discussed given that with rising temperature spin fluctuations become increasingly important ultimately leading to a softening of the 110 shear modulus and to the $\alpha$-bcc/$\gamma$-bcc structural phase transformation.},

The use of this result is illustrated by a 'toy' mass-action kinetics model which offers insight into vacancy concentration, rate constants, and enthalpy of reaction.},

We computed the contribution of Mg vibrations to the specific heat and investigated the softening of Mg phonon spectra, where the maximum allowed vibrational frequency is lowered and highly collective diffusion processes are promoted. The statistical correlation between the reported critical casting thickness of the alloys and softening of Mg phonons was obtained. Similar calculations were performed for two distinctively different amorphous ZrTiCuAl alloys with large and small reported critical casting thickness, respectively. The findings were consistent with those of the MgZnCa alloys.},

ZrC pellets with a variety of relative densities are obtained under different processing parameters. The densification kinetics of ZrC powders subjected to conventional hot pressing and SPS are comparatively studied by applying similar heating and loading profiles. Due to the lack of electric current assistance, the conventional hot pressing appears to impose lower strain rate sensitivity and higher activation energy values than those which correspond to the SPS processing. A finite element simulation is used to analyze the temperature evolution within the volume of ZrC specimens subjected to SPS. The control mechanism for grain growth during the final SPS stage is studied via a recently modified model, in which the grain growth rate dependence on porosity is incorporated. The constant pressure specific heat and thermal conductivity of the SPS-processed ZrC are determined to be higher than those reported for the hot-pressed ZrC and the benefits of applying SPS are indicated accordingly.},

In the present study, using first-principles, we have calculated the properties of a number of stable and metastable zirconium carbides ZrC1-x (x = 0 and 1/n, n = 2-8) which were predicted by the evolutionary algorithm USPEX. Effects of carbon vacancies on the structures, mechanical properties, and chemical bonding of these zirconium carbides were systematically investigated. The distribution of carbon vacancies has significant influence on mechanical properties, especially Pugh's ratio. Nonadjacent carbon vacancies enhance Pugh's ratio, while grouped carbon vacancies decrease Pugh's ratio. This is explained by the changes in strength of Zr-C and Zr-Zr bonding around differently distributed carbon vacancies. We further explored the mechanical properties of zirconium carbides with impurities (N and O) by inserting N and O atoms into the sites of carbon vacancies. The enhanced mechanical properties of zirconium carbides were found.},

abstract = {A popular method of extracting phonon frequencies from ab initio calculations is to find the equilibrium structure of a material and then build up the matrix of force constants by calculating forces acting due to small displacements of the atoms. If the range of the force constants is assumed to be short, as it typically is in parametrized force-model calculations, the entire dispersion relation can be evaluated from data taken from small ab initio calculations. In this paper we highlight the practical difficulties introduced by low-symmetry structures with free internal parameters and present practical solutions to them. By way of example, we present a number of calculations where solution of these problems is essential. These include ab initio calculation of phonon dispersion in a non-centrosymmetric structure (silver gallium diselenide) and good agreement between calculations and neutron scattering data for a structure with free internal parameters (germanium sulphide).},

abstract = {Practical free energy reconstruction algorithms involve three separate tasks: biasing, measuring some observable, and finally reconstructing the free energy surface from those measurements. In more than one dimension, adaptive schemes make it possible to explore only relatively low lying regions of the landscape by progressively building up the bias toward the negative of the free energy surface so that free energy barriers are eliminated. Most schemes use the final bias as their best estimate of the free energy surface. We show that large gains in computational efficiency, as measured by the reduction of time to solution, can be obtained by separating the bias used for dynamics from the final free energy reconstruction itself. We find that biasing with metadynamics, measuring a free energy gradient estimator, and reconstructing using Gaussian process regression can give an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost.},

It is based on ab initio molecular dynamics followed by a mapping onto a model Hamiltonian that describes the lattice dynamics. The formalism and the numerical aspects of the technique are described in detail. A number of practical examples are given, and results are presented, which confirm the usefulness of TDEP within ab initio and classical molecular dynamics frameworks. In particular, we examine from first principles the behavior of force constants upon the dynamical stabilization of the body centered phase of Zr, and show that they become more localized. We also calculate the phase diagram for 4He modeled with the Aziz et al. potential and obtain results which are in favorable agreement both with respect to experiment and established techniques.},

@article{Gillan1983,
abstract = {The problem of calculating the entropy of formation of a point defect in an ionic crystal is reexamined in some detail. We use two methods of calculation, which we term the embedded-crystallite and the Green-function methods. In both methods, the crystal is divided into an inner region, which contains the defect and a set of its neighbors, and an outer region. In the embedded-crystallite method, the entropy is calculated directly from the determinants of the force-constant matrices for perfect and defective crystals, restricted to the defect region. The Green-function method, which is expected to be more accurate, exploits a reformulation of the entropy expression in terms of the Green functions of the perfect crystal and the change of the force constants in the defect region. The principal feature of our calculations is the examination, for the first time in ionic crystals, of the convergence of the calculated entropy as the size of the defect region is increased. Associated problems, such as the correct inclusion of the long-range Coulomb contributions and the accuracy of the Green functions, have also been addressed. The model numerical calculations which we present are for the case of Frenkel (vacancy and interstitial) defects in CaF2. The majority of the calculations have been performed with the use of a rigid-ion potential, which allows a simpler discussion of the technical problems, but we have also investigated the effect on the results of using a realistic shell model. We show that the convergence of the results is strongly affected by previously unrecognized fluctuation effects coming from the boundary of the defect region; these effects are specific to ionic crystals. It is demonstrated that the boundary effects can be eliminated with the use of a simple substraction technique, and that the resulting entropy values can be extrapolated to infinite region size with an uncertainty of no more than a few tenths of Boltzmann's constant. It is pointed out that in a finite crystal there is a contribution to the entropy of charged defects from the structure of the physical surface; this contribution cancels out, however, for neutral sets of defects. We discuss previous work on this problem in the light of our findings.},

The solid solutions of carbon in the h.c.p. and b.c.c. phases of Zr and the non-stoichiometric NaCl-type structure ZrCx carbide are treated by using the compound energy model (CEM) for interstitial phases. The liquid phase is treated by using a substitutional solution model and the Redlich-Kister formalism for excess Gibbs energies. The parameters in the models are determined by computerized optimization of selected experimental data. The metastable carbides ZrC0.5 and ZrC3, that are involved in the CEM for the interstitial solutions of C in h.c.p. and b.c.c. Zr respectively, are described using estimated values for the entropy and enthalpy of formation. These estimates are based on the regular behaviour of the vibrational entropy and other cohesive properties which have been established in recent studies on transition metal compounds. A thermodynamic description is obtained which is used to construct, by calculation, the ZrC phase diagram.

abstract = {We report a pseudopotential-based density functional theory (DFT) investigation of the interface between ZrC and bcc Fe. ZrC is a potential candidate for a protective coating for ferritic steels because of its favorable physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Here we predict the atomic structure, bonding, and ideal work of adhesion (Wad ideal) of the interface formed between the most stable surfaces of ZrC and bcc Fe, namely, the ZrC(100)/Fe(110) interface. Bulk properties of ZrC and bcc Fe, calculated for calibration of the DFT approximations involved, are in good agreement with experiment. Further, all the low-index surfaces of ZrC and bcc Fe are observed to retain near ideal bulk termination, as observed experimentally. Stabilities of both ZrC and bcc Fe surfaces follow their respective packing density sequence, i.e., (110){\textless}(111){\textless}(100) for ZrC and (111){\textless}(100) {\textless}(110) for bcc Fe. Based on surface energy values, we estimate that the critical stress required for crack propagation in bcc Fe to be at least 30{\%} larger than in ZrC. The ZrC(100)/Fe(110) interface is well lattice-matched (≈1.7{\%} strain) producing a fairly smooth interface with little structural relaxation. Bonding at the interface consists of covalent C p-Fe d mixing and some metallic Zr d-Fe d interactions. As the coating grows, decreases in inter-metallic bonding, coupled with increased intraceramic interactions, weaken the interfacial bonding. While a monolayer of ZrC is tightly bound to an Fe substrate (Wideal=3.05 J/m2), the adhesion decreases upon film thickening, with the asymptotic value of Wad ideal reached for 4 ML of ZrC (∼2.3 J/m2). This interface strength is sufficiently high that it may survive as a coating for steels in extreme environments, though it is much smaller than the minimum energy required for fracture of either ZrC or Fe. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ab initio modeling of materials has become routine in recent years, largely due to the success of density functional theory (DFT). However, for many processes in materials, realism is achieved only when millions of atoms are considered. Currently, such large scale simulations are beyond ab initio capabilities so that one has to resort to effective interatomic potentials that well represent ab initio data on smaller scales. Two of the more widely used types of interatomic potentials are embedded atom method (EAM) and modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potentials. Here we present a code that can use ab initio generated energies and forces to obtain representative EAM and reference-free MEAM type effective interatomic potentials. We illustrate the use of this code with ab initio computed thermal excitations in ZrC.

For an EAM potential fit to 670 energies, a few hours on a single core is usually sufficient to produce a potential with R=12{\%}-13{\%} (see Equation. 9 in main-text for definition). To ensure a maximally optimized potential however (R=12{\%}), a run-time of 24 hours is recommended. To optimize a RF-MEAM potential, a further 24 hours should be allowed. One will already find an improvement over the EAM using just a single core, however to ensure a maximally optimized potential, one should run several instances of MEAMfit in parallel. References:J.

@article{Grabowski2009,
abstract = {We propose a fully ab initio based integrated approach to determine the volume and temperature dependent free-energy surface of nonmagnetic crystalline solids up to the melting point. The approach is based on density-functional theory calculations with a controlled numerical accuracy of better than 1 meV/atom. It accounts for all relevant excitation mechanisms entering the free energy including electronic, quasiharmonic, anharmonic, and structural excitations such as vacancies. To achieve the desired accuracy of {\textless}1 meV/atom for the anharmonic free-energy contribution without losing the ability to perform these calculations on standard present-day computer platforms, we develop a numerically highly efficient technique: we propose a hierarchical scheme—called upsampled thermodynamic integration using Langevin dynamics—which allows for a significant reduction in the number of computationally expensive ab initio configurations compared to a standard molecular dynamics scheme. As for the vacancy contribution, concentration-dependent pressure effects had to be included to achieve the desired accuracy. Applying the integrated approach gives us direct access to the free-energy surface F(V,T) for aluminum and derived quantities such as the thermal expansion coefficient or the isobaric heat capacity and allows a direct comparison with experiment. A detailed analysis enables us to tackle the long-standing debate over which excitation mechanism (anharmonicity vs vacancies) is dominant close to the melting point.},

@article{Eschrig2010,
abstract = {A logical foundation of equilibrium state density functional theory in a Kohn-Sham-type formulation is presented on the basis of Mermin's treatment of the grand canonical state by exploiting functional Legendre transforms. It is simpler and more satisfactory compared to the usual derivation of the ground-state theory and free of most remaining open points of the latter. The existence of the functional derivative of the corresponding density functional F[n] at all densities of grand canonical equilibrium states is proved even in the spin-density matrix version of the theory. It may, in particular, be relevant with respect to cases of spontaneous symmetry breaking such as noncollinear magnetism and orbital order.},

@article{Hickel2011,
abstract = {The performance of materials such as steels, their high strength and formability, is based on an impressive variety of competing mechanisms on the microscopic/atomic scale (e.g., dislocation gliding, solid solution hardening, mechanical twinning or structural phase trans- formations). Whereas many of the currently available concepts to describe these mechanisms are based on empirical and experimental data, it becomes more and more apparent that fur- ther improvement of materials needs to be based on a more fundamental level. Recent progress in the field of ab initio methods makes now the exploration of chemical trends, the determination of parameters for phenomenological models, and the identification of new routes for the optimization of steel properties feasible. A major challenge in applying these methods to a true materials design is, however, the inclusion of temperature driven effects on the desired properties. Therefore, a large range of computational tools has been developed in order to improve the capability and accuracy of first-principles methods in determining free energies. These combine electronic, vibrational, and magnetic effects as well as struc- tural defects in an integrated approach. Based on these simulation tools, one is now able to successfully predict mechanical and thermodynamic properties of metals with a hitherto not achievable accuracy.},
